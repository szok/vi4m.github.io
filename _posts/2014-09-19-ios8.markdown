Things i like about IOS8 so far:

* finally someone discovers truth about widgets - it is unconfortable to mix application launchers with widgets on home screen
* it's better to move widgets to the *notification area* to be shown only when really you want to get information
* SWIFT programming language is really fast, Python-like and easy.
