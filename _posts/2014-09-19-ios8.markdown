Things i like about IOS8 so far:

* Swift! Finally something better than 30 years old, f**ed up ObjectiveC. Finally something more Python-like. Bring it to the Android!
* Widgets not on home screen, but on notification bar. It's much easier to scroll than the mixed icons/widgets home screens.
* Customizability. Well, that was a long trip to the *custom keyboards and widgets*, but it was worth of it. You can extend the apps using built-in parts architecture (for example Photos app can "grant access" to the picture without doubling the resources)


The BAD things:

* It's slow as hell on Iphone 4s
* Unstable on every device


So there you have! Android on Iphone - finally :)
