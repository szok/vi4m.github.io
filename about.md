This site is dedicated to the *Sexy Software Craftmanship*. 

Don't do just Agile, TDD, software that only 'works' and is clunky, slow and/or bloated. 
Be excited and contributed to the smallest details of user experience, internal design, and performance.
Be commited to the [Software Craftmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org) and make software fast, usable and sexy!
