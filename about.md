This site is dedicated to the *Sexy Software Craftmanship*. 

Don't do just Agile, TDD, software that only 'works' and is clunky, slow and/or bloated. 
Be excited and contributed to the smallest details of user experience, internal design, and performance.
Be commited to the [Software Craftmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org) and make software fast, usable and sexy!


Marcin Kliks

Passionate programmer since Commodore 64. 

I believe in the open source, [tasty](http://40hz.se/fatmanifesto/principles.html) software without compromises, and [simplicity](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/ "Python Zen").

I am the Lead Programmer of [Ralph DCIM/CMDB software]( http://ralph.allegrogroup.com) and couple of other [Open Source projects](/projects). I love Python programming language.
